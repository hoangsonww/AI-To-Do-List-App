SQL, HTML, Java

Using cutting-edge machine learning algorithms, this app not only tracks users' tasks and reminds them of upcoming deadlines, but also offers personalized recipe suggestions based on their dietary preferences, 
ingredients on hand, and cooking experience level. Say goodbye to boring meals and hello to culinary creativity!
As the lead developer of this project, I worked closely with a team of designers and data scientists to bring this app to life. 
From ideation to implementation, we prioritized user experience and personalization to create an intuitive and enjoyable application that adapts to their unique needs.
